#Level 1

Problem
	- Find password for next level which is stored in "readme" file in home directory
	- Login into bandit1 using this password via "ssh"
	- Default port no for all bandit levels is 2220

Theory
	- We can use "ls" command to list all the directory contents.
	- We can cat command to see contents of a file.
	- We can also use cat command to concatenate files.
	- The syntax to view contents of the file is "cat file_name.extension"
	- The syntax to concatenate a file is "cat > file_name.extension" 
	- We can use "cd" command to change directory.
	- The syntax to use "cd" is "cd directory_name", where directory_name is in the current directory.
	- We can also use "cd .." to go one step back into the parent directory.

Solution
	- For viewing contents of "readme" file, we can write "cat readme"
	- The password for logging into next level is "boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1"
	- We can login into next level using "ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the given password.
