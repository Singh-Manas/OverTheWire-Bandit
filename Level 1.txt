#Level 2

Problem
	- Find password for next level which is stored in "-" file in home directory
	- Login into bandit2 using this password via "ssh"

Theory
	- When we try to use "cat -", it will not work because if we use '-' as an argument in place of a file name it refers to STDIN/STDOUT.
	- Using "-" as a filename to mean stdin/stdout is a convention that a lot of programs use.
	- So, if you want to open this type of file, we have to specify the full location of the file such as "cat ./-"

Solution
	- Hence to open "-" file, we need to write "cat ./-" in the current directory where file is located.
	- The password for logging into next level is "CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9"
	- We can login into next level using "ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the given password.
