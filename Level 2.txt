#Level 2

Problem
	- Find password for next level which is stored in "spaces in this filename" file in home directory
	- Login into bandit3 using this password via "ssh"

Theory
	- We can see contents of a file using cat command but the problem arises because of space in file name.
	- When we try to directly write a command and give file name which has spaces as argument, the shell interprets it as multiple arguments not as a single file name.
	- For Example - When we use "cat spaces in the filename" the shell will interpret it as cat with 4 arguments i.e spaces, in, the, filename. So it will try to open these 4 files not the file with "spaces in the filename".
	- To fix this we have 2 methods - 
		(a) Escape Character Method
			-> We can use escape character of space i.e "\<space>" to convey space in the filename.
			-> Escape characters have special meaning when used in a character sequence.
			-> For Example: We can use change directory to "new dir" using cd as "cd new\ dir".
		(b) Using Double Quotes
			-> We can also specify filenames by enclosing it in double quotes. This will help us to specify filenames without using escape character.
			-> For Example: We can use change directory to "new dir" using cd as 'cd "new dir"'.

Solution
	- We can see contents of file using "cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename".
	- We can also see contents using 'cat "spaces in this filename"'.
	- There is a shortcut for writing filenames with escape charcter by writing few letters of filename and then pressing "Tab". This will automatically insert escape characters at appropriate places in the filename.
	- The password for logging into next level is "UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK".
	- We can login into next level using "ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the given password.
