Problem 
	- Login into the game using given hostname, port no, username and password.

Theory
	- We can login to a remote host and execute remote commands by using "ssh" [Secure Shell] command.
	- The syntax to login using ssh is 
		$ ssh <username>@<remotehost> 
	- For specifying port no add "-p 0000", where 0000 is the desired port no.
	- You will be asked for password once the connection is established. 
	
Solution
	"ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220"
