#Level 6

Problem
	- Find password for next level which is stored somewhere on the server and has following properties
		-> Owned by user bandit7
		-> Owned by group bandit6
		-> 33 bytes in size
	- Login into bandit7 using this password via "ssh"

Theory
	- We can use "find" command to find files which satisfy above conditions.
	- We can use "user" option to find files which belongs to user. Ex - "find . -user username".
	- We can use "group" option to find files which belongs to group. Ex - "find . -group groupname".

Solution
	- To find files which satisfy above conditions anywhere on the server, we can use "find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c".
	- By executing above command, we see there is one file "/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password" which contains password.
	- The password for logging into next level is "HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs"
	- We can login into next level using "ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the given password.
