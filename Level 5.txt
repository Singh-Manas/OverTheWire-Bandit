#Level 5

Problem
	- Find password for next level which is stored in a file under the "inhere" directory which has following properties
		-> Human - readable
		-> 1033 bytes in size
		-> not executable
	- Login into bandit6 using this password via "ssh"

Theory
	- "Find" command is used to find files and directories and perform subsequent operations on them.
	- It supports searching by file, folder, name, creation date, modification date, owner and permissions. 
	- By using the ‘-exec’ other UNIX commands can be executed on files or folders found.
	- We can use "find" command to find files of specific size and not executable files in the current directory and subdirectories.
	- The syntax for "find" command is 
		$ find [where to start searching from] [expression determines what to find] [-options] [what to find]
		-> To find file of specific size in current directory syntax can be written as "find . -size 1033c" where c represents file size in bytes.
		-> To find files of not executable nature in current directory we can write "find . ! -exec".
		-> To specify type i.e file or directories to be searched we can specify "type" option. If "type" option is "f" that means find files and if option is "d" find directories.
	- "File" command is used to determine the type of a file. File may be of 2 types - 
		-> Human Readable (Ex - ASCII Text)
		-> MIME Type (Ex - text/plain; charset=us-ascii)
	- To find file type in a directory, we can write "file *".
	
Solution
	- First we can find files with size 1033 bytes and that are not executable using "find -size 1033c ! -executable"
	- The above statment will return list of files that has size 1033 bytes and that are not executable.
	- We can see that there is only one file with size 1033 bytes and not executable.
	- To check if file is human readable we can write "file inhere/maybehere07/.file2".
	- To see contents of file we can write "cat inhere/maybehere07/.file2".
	- The password for logging into next level is "DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7"
	- We can login into next level using "ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220" and the given password.
